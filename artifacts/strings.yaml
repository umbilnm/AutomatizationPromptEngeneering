    I'm trying to write a zero-shot classifier prompt.
    
    My current prompt is:
    "{prompt}"

    But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:
    {error_string}

    give {num_feedbacks} reasons why the prompt could have gotten these examples wrong.
    Wrap each reason with <START> and <END>

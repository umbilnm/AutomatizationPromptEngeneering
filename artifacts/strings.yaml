      I'm trying to write a zero-shot classifier prompt.
      
      My current prompt is:
      "{prompt}"

      But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:
      {error_string}

      Give {num_feedbacks} advices how to update the prompt to make it better for this examples.

          Based on these examples there are few advices how to upgrade this prompt\n{feedback_str}

          Based on the above information, I wrote {steps_per_gradient} different improved prompts.
          Wrap each prompt with <START> and <END>.

          The {steps_per_gradient} new prompts are:
